Designed a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for anemia classification from scratch using PyTorch. The project involved implementing custom neural network layers, backpropagation, and hyperparameter tuning. The model was trained on medical data to accurately classify different types of anemia, achieving competitive accuracy. The project demonstrated a deep understanding of neural network fundamentals.
